# Solar-Panel-Fault-Detection-App
This project is a computer-vision based solar PV fault detection tool that automates solar asset inspection. It classifies panels as Clean, Physical Damage, or Electrical Fault using a TensorFlow Lite model and Streamlit UI. It supports single/batch image analysis and exports CSV reports for field diagnostics in real-world solar operations.
